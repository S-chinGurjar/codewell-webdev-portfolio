## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned


I learned better using semantic HTML markup .

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I'd like to design next website with mobile-first workflow .
