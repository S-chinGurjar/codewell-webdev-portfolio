                    The combined experience I have working at the Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develope a skillset that help me not in just development, but in every aspect of my buisness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to <i>sell yourself</i> and open them to a whole world of opportunities.

                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.

                <p>
                    A qoute I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
